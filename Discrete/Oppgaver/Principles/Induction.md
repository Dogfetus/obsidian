we use three steps for inductive proofs:
- prove the property initially for 0 (or the starting value)
- assume the implication condition
- prove the implication consequence

for example:
statement: for all numbers greater or equal to 3, the sum of the previous natural numbers is greater or equal to the number itself
This becomes :

Ɐx ≥ 3 \[ $\sum_{i=0}^{x-1}{i}$ ≥ x\]
or:
Ɐx ≥ 3 \[ $\sum_{i=0}^{x}{i}$ ≥ s(x)\]
