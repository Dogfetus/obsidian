### asnwer:
In this task you need to look at the picture and determine the different terminals and nonterminalsa swell as startingpiont and rules. 
terminals => all the labels on the arrows
non-terminals => all the lables on the nodes
startingpoint => the node with the empty arrow pointing to it
rules => provided by the arrow pointing out from each node with its corresponding terminal and ending non-terminal. For double lines they can also just stop as $\epsilon$.

### answer:
For this task the weaker an equation is, is determined by how many possible solutions it has. This means that x = x would be the weakest, since it holds true for every single possible value for x. This is followed by x $\neq$ 1, since this holds true for every single value for x except 1. Then at medium is the same as shown in the picture, since x can be three different values. Thereafter, the quadratic polinomial equation is placed correct at strong since it has two different values for x. Then we top it all of with 6x = 24 as the strongset, since x can only be one value: 4. 
Final result would look like this:
- strongest: 6x = 24                       : 1 solution
- strong: $x^2-12x+32 = 0$           : 2 solutions
- medium: $x\in \{4,8,12\}$                : 3 solutions
- weak: $x\neq1$                                 : infinite - 1 solutions
- weakest: x = x                             : infinite solutions

### answer: 
here (7, 5) means essentially (x, y) so if xRy ((x, y) in R) then (y, x) must also be in R (since symmetric) but this is antisymmetric, so we know that this is only true when y = x, such that we only get (x, x) in R.
