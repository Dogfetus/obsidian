Apperently [LCM](Discrete/Oppgaver/Arithmetic/Least%20common%20multiple)(a,b) * [GCD](Discrete/Oppgaver/Arithmetic/Greatest%20common%20divisor)(a,b) = a * b. According to the [Theorem about gcd and lcm](https://uia.instructure.com/courses/16240/files/2639182?module_item_id=627022) (page 47).
which means we can use the greatest common divisor multiplied with the least common multiple to find the result of the two numbers (a and b) multiplied with one another.

We have a couple defenitions of arithmetic operations: [lecture](https://uia.instructure.com/courses/16240/files/2629763?module_item_id=623801)

We use these definitions when we want to show the proof of certain theorems.
as shown in the picture above. (1+1)
