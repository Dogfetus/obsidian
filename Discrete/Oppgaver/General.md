# General info:

### gcd and lcm:
Apperently [LCM](Discrete/Oppgaver/Arithmetic/Least%20common%20multiple)(a,b) * [GCD](Discrete/Oppgaver/Arithmetic/Greatest%20common%20divisor)(a,b) = a * b. According to the [Theorem about gcd and lcm](https://uia.instructure.com/courses/16240/files/2639182?module_item_id=627022) (page 47).
which means we can use the greatest common divisor multiplied with the least common multiple to find the result of the two numbers (a and b) multiplied with one another.

### basic 
We have a couple defenitions of arithmetic operations: [lecture](https://uia.instructure.com/courses/16240/files/2629763?module_item_id=623801)
Basic arithmetic proof:

successor proofs:

We use these definitions when we want to show the proof of certain theorems.
as shown in the picture above (1+1).


here is another example using the definitions to prove 7 + 2:

we use these definitions to prove other equations and such.

We can also calculate what a number will be in different bases, by converting the number first to base 10 if its not already in base 10. Then we do the instructions described in [[Other Bases]].
