These are just the extra tasks:
For A={a,b,c,d,e,f,g} determine the number of (a) subsets of A, (b) nonempty subsets of A, (c) proper subsets of A, (d) subsets of A containing 3 elements, (e) subsets of A containing only vowels, (f) subsets of A with an odd number of elements.

a)
	The number of subsets of sequence A with n elements, is $2^n$

b)
	The number of empty subsets in the sequence is exactly 1, which means the number of nonempty subsets is $2^n - 1$. 

c)
